Hack Overflow

Like Stack Overflow, but for HRRB participants

To combat the ephemerality of slack with persistant and organized technical information

Right now the only method of communication current HRRB students and alumni have is Slack.  Slack is great for real-time messaging, but great technical advice and resources often get lost in a sea of giphys and emoticons - not to mention that the history only goes back a few days.  

Hack Overflow is a web app where current students and alums can post and answer questions related to specfic tehcnical topics.  Users would be allowed to comment on posts with their answers. They can also browse the general forum, or go to a specific forum to see information on a certain topic.       

"This is the resource we wished we had as HRRB students." - Everyone

"Before Hack Overflow, I was so bummed when I forgot to save a link to an excellent Node resource and it disappeared forever a few days later. Now I don't have to worry - I can search for all cool resources I want that have been vetted by my peers on Hack Overflow."

We hope to see you soon.
